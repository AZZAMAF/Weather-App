# ☁️ Weather App – Simple, Sleek, and Functional

This app helps you check the weather without the clutter. Just type a city name, and boom—your forecast appears.

## What It Does
- Shows current temperature, sky condition, humidity & wind speed
- Clean interface that works on phone and desktop
- Built using vanilla JavaScript + OpenWeatherMap API

## Why I Made It
I wanted to explore how to work with real-time APIs and make something people could actually use. Also… weather is kinda fun, right?
